# TODO:
- Fullscreen
- A startup screen where it has the creator's name (me) as the first few seconds of the menu theme plays and then BOOM menu 
- UI overhaul -> menus, settings menu, game ui, and everything to do with UI
- Polish -> Particles, text popping up for hits, combos, critical hits, time increases, and etc.

# FIX 
- TO MUCH FUCKING ALLOCATIONS!!
- Timer is fucked if the game was started too quickly. Either turn vsync on or do the startup screen which will gain us some time
- More accruate colliders
- Scale up the UI a bit
- Disable camera movements 
- Adjust sensitivity in the settings menu
