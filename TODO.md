# TODO:
- UI overhaul -> tasks menu menus, settings menu, game ui, and everything to do with UI
- A startup screen where it has the creator's name (me) as the first few seconds of the menu theme plays and then BOOM menu 
- Playtest -> refine the tasks
- Polish -> text popping up for hits, combos, critical hits, time increases, and etc.
